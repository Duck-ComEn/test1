slotio20110323_build_1168.tqz (Work around)
-------------------------------------------
1) Call setTargetTemperature inside setSafeHandlingTemperature instead of TER_GoToSafe. This is a workaround for safe handling
   functionality turning off drive voltage which resulted in unrecoverable UART2 errors.
2) This is workaround. No QA has been done. 


slotio20110318_build_1167.tqz
-----------------------------
1) 12V drive margining is not supported, undesired behavior will occur if 12V drive voltage is set below 12V.  5V margining is supported.
2) 5V rise time is supported from 2ms-100ms, 5V fall time is supported from 10ms-100ms.  Undesired behavior will occur if a fall time less 
   than 10ms is requested.
3) Updated makefile.slotio. Corrected rpclib path.


slotio20110309_build_1166.tqz
-----------------------------
 *  1) Implemented getActualCurrent() to read actual current for 5V and 12V
 *  2) Changed Logging - Log file for a slot is not one big file any more. A log file will be called siSetDebugLogLevel() is called.
 *     Date and time stamps are used in the log file names [Example: slot10_2011.03.09.10.55.56.log]
 *  3) Fixed potential memory leak in Neptune SIO2 lib.


slotio20110307_build_1165.tqz
-----------------------------
 *  1) setVoltageRiseTime & getVoltageRiseTime
 *  2) Added terPrintSlotInfo() print version info and serial numbers. 
 *  3) Re-implement siSetDriveFanRPM with real SIO API.
 *  4) TLOG_EXIT now prints function name.
 *  5) 12V control for Enterprise
 *  6) Fixed truncation errors in the case x100 numbers. Rounding up instead.
 *  7) In case of RPC errors, disconnect, reconnect and retry failed command X times.
 *  8) SIO Journal related changes a) Disable logging by default b) New API which is slot specific c) Print SIO Journal only on error.


slotio20110224_p3_1r1_envelope_extra_logging.tqz release
--------------------------------------------------------
 *  1) Temperature Envelope support.
 *  2) Enhanced logging - Log return values for function calls where return values are in function parameters.
 *  3) Validate setTargetTemperature, setPositiveTemperatureRampRate, setNegativeTemperatureRampRate by reading back from SIO/DIO

slotio20110208_p3r1_3_one_slot_sio_dio_state.tqz release
--------------------------------------------------------
 *  1) Convert 0 based slot indices to 1 based
 *  2) Implementation of SIO/DIO state detection.


slotio20110204_p3r1_3_fpga_300us_turnaround.tqz release
-------------------------------------------------------
 *  1) This release includes updated FPGA (40.1) which is expected to fix the following issues.
 *       a) High UART2 errors - This was related to smaller turnaround delay (15us) after we receive good response (0x80) from the drive.
 *          In this FPGA, this delay is fixed 300us.
 *       b) Long duration test failure - All slots were failing after 1+ hours. After the first screeching halt, all future commands
 *          to drives were failing.
 *     This releases contains new FPGA (4.14) with fixed 300us (same as inter character delay for EB7 drives) turnaround delay.
 *  2) Added declaration of mutex_slotio as requested by Katayama-san.
 *  3) Added calls to set inter character delay, ack timeout and logging enable in siInitialize, as requested by Katayama-san
 *  4) Enabled isSlotThere() in siInitialize.
 *  5) Fixed setSafeHandlingTemperature(). This call was always failing before.
 *  6) respLength was not correctly set in TER_SioReceiveBuffer call. Because of this echo and read commands were taking longer
 *     time than expected. Fixed this in many APIs.
 *  7) Testcase calls many APIs with 30 secs as timeout value. SIO API supports timeouts only up to 10secs. Added code to truncate
 *     timeouts to 10sec.
 *  8) Initial code for SIO/DIO status and temp envelope. Code exists, but commented out.
 *  9) Improvements/clean up/enhancements to wapitest (not applicable to Hitachi since this Teradyne's test code)


slotio20110113_p3r1_1.tqz release
---------------------------------------------
 *  Jan-11-2011, MG:
 *  1) Supported Phase 3 APIs -  getHeaterOutput, getCellInventory, getReferenceTemperature, siGetDriveUartVersion, 
 *     siResetDrive,siSetDriveDelayTime, setHeaterOutput, getShutterPosition, setShutterPosition, 
 *     setTemperatureSensorCarlibrationData, setVoltageCalibration, siSetDriveFanRPM, siSetElectronicsFanRPM
 *  2) Comment out isSlotThere() from siInitialize()


slotio20110106_p2r1_1_sio_journal.tqz release
---------------------------------------------
 *   1) Incorporated changes from Katayama-san
 *   2) Changed the name of hitachi test utility to a more meaningful name (wapitest) from (hitachi2)
 *   3) Added preliminary coding for 64K FIFO support [Not tested. Do not make a call to read > 2K]
 *   4) Added SIO journal support. SIO Journal should be enabled by siSetDebugLogLevel(). SIO Journal will
 *      be printed to a log at the end of a test (siFinalize)



slotio20101220_p2r1_1_screeching_halt.tqz
-----------------------------------------
Release Notes
 *   1) Added API for bulk read - siBulkReadFromDrive().
 *   2) FPGA screeching halt - With FPGA 4.11, if an error is encountered during transmission to drive,
 *      it will halt transmission and sets a status bit. Wrapper API is responsible for detecting and
 *      clearing this condition and pushing the error code to Testcase for error handling. Wrapper 
 *      API return values has changed [0=success, 1=Teradyne Error, 2=Drive Error].
 *   3) Preliminary coding changes for journaling [SIO level log].
 *   4) Code change and restructuring around logging and tracing..

Notes: Write drive memory test is temporarily removed from the test suite, until a firmware fix from
       Hitachi is available.

 *      where N=slot number
 *   3) Changed some of the hard-coded values to #defines.
 
Notes: Write drive memory test is temporarily removed from the test suite, until a firmware fix from
       Hitachi is available.

Debug Log and Error tracing:
----------------------------
The following 3 types of logging shall be supported. 

1) Error tracing - Enabled by default on each slot - reports back only the error.
   Supported in this release
2) Wrapper level debugging
   Supported in this release - see the sample file output 
3) Journal Diagnostics - - Must enable a slot, a series of slots or all slots - reports, with time stamps, the entire set of transactions
   from receive to response. 
   Not supported in this release 
   
   Sample Journal Diagnostics:
   Time: 5275.047289: (-1.996448): slotid:   0, State:  0 <SS_STATE_init>,  Type: 1 <state>, Status: 0

slotio20101207_p1r1_0.tqz
-------------------------
Release Notes
-------------

 *   1) Incorporated patch from HGST 
 *   2) Multiple baud rate support (115200,460800,921600,1843200,2778000 3333000,4167000,5556000,8333000)
 *   3) Voltage margining is working. setTargetVoltage() can be used to set 5V +- 10%.
 *   4) UART level is fixed at 2.5V. However, setting to 0 will enable staggered spin.
 *   5) Added siBulkWriteDriveMemory(). This function disables UART2 before sending and
 *      re-enables after done.
 *   6) Added code to print serial no/ver. info in siInitialize.
 *   7) Added SIO IP address support. Use export SIOIPADDRESS="xx.xx.xx.xx". If this env is
 *      not defined, ip address will default to 10.101.1.2
 *   8) Added siGetLastErrors for debugging SIO errors. This will be called in TERERROR(). This function
 *      last 132 bytes of console info.
 *   9) Added code to flush receive buffer before sending Echo, Read and Write command.

 Notes: MG: I saw intermittent failures writing to the drive memory. Sometimes I don't read the value which was written. 
        Sometimes WAPI does not get the expected number of bytes. 
        HGST: We are investigating same problem in Fujisawa. Write command is completed with correct checksum value, 
        but read back data value at same memory address does not match to write data value. I heard some drive firmware 
        level has this issue, so now we are trying to update drive firmware then will check it again
    


slotio20101201_fixed_pup_interchar_delay.tqz
--------------------------------------------

Release Notes
-------------
 *   1) Fixed DUT powerup. Echo command does not require <slot> 1 pup from console anymore.
 *   2) Added siGetInterCharacterDelay and siSetInterCharacterDelay. 
 *   3) isSlotThere is fixed. Returns correct status code.
 *   4) Implemented siSetUartProtocol. Depending on the prototype, Echo and Read command
 *      will perform endian swap.  
 Note 1) I saw intermittent failures writing to the drive memory. Sometimes I don't read the value which was written. Sometimes WAPI does not get the expected number of bytes.
